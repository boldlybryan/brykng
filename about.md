I'm a front-end web developer and designer with over 2 years of experience building user interfaces and content authoring tools at Flagstar Bank. In my free time, I help small-to-medium sized companies solve their business problems with design and technology. These problems include: e-commerce stores, custom web apps, landing page design/development, and more!

In 2015, I graduated from Oakland University with a degree in Management Information Systems. Since my formal training was at the crossroads of business and technology, I'm much better equipped for solving your company's problems than your average designer or developer. Much of my studies focused on managing technology projects, so I understand that your business goals come first, and technology/design follow.

Stay tuned for an in-depth bio, coming soon!
