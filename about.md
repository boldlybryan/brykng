I'm a front-end web developer and designer with over 2 years of experience coding user interfaces and content authoring tools at Flagstar Bank. In my free time, I help small-to-medium sized companies solve their business problems with design and technology. These problems include: e-commerce stores, custom web apps, landing page design/development, and more!

In 2015, I graduated from Oakland University with a degree in Management Information Systems. Since my formal training was at the crossroads of business and technology, I'm much better equipped for solving your company's problems than your average designer or developer. Much of my studies focused on managing tech projects, so I understand that your business goals come first, and technology and design follow.

Today, I'm working on becoming a one stop shop, full-stack web guy, if you will. I may not be the greatest from a technical or creative standpoint, but I am talented at putting it all together to solve problems. [Continue elaborating on how I put it all together]. I really don't like the message of this paragraph.

Outside of building websites, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Katie. Since we've recently moved to the Queen City, we love exploring our new hometown together. A new addition to our family has been, Penny, the two year old pup we adopted shortly after we got back from our honeymoon. She's brought so much joy into our lives and we're very glad she's with us!

Some of my other hobbies and interests include: camping, hiking, archery, football, beer, economics, and more.
