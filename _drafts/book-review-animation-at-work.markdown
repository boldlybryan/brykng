title: 'Book Review: Animation at Work'
---

Recently, I've taken more interest in UX/UI animation. I feel comfortable with my ability to set type nicely, position elements accordingly, and pick pretty colors. But whenever I finish building something, I always think to myself "What's missing?" The answer is motion.


Animation at Work, by Rachael Nabors, is the 6th part of A Book Apart Briefs. It's a bite-sized read on the basics of animation on the web. I breezed through it in an evening, and I gained so much insight on a subject I had little knowledge on.

[Summary, key points, etc]

I'll definitely be playing around with Nabors' suggestions in the very near future. I'm planning on trying out a few of the popular motion-focusesld design tools. If you want to watch my animation skills blossom, follow me over on Dribbble!
