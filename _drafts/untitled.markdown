Lately, I've been thinking a lot about learning and growth.

Looking back, I was a terrible student in college. I spent my college years ignoring my education. I didn't want to be in school. I thought it was pointless and a waste of time. But I was told I needed it. That I couldn't have the things I wanted without it. So I put forth the bare minimum just to get by. 

I didn't feel challenged, or at least the challenges I faced weren't interesting to me. The classes I did best and learned the most from were both of those things. If I was fascinated by a subject, I put the time in and took it as a challenge. If it was boring or seemed useless, I could care less.

The problem I now see was that I didn't seek out things that interested me and learn about them. I saw each class as an obligation, something that stood between me and what I wanted. So I went through the motions, did what I had to do. But I didn't grow as a result. 

I think this poses a greater question about education. Why do we go to school? What are we supposed to get out of it? I think the mistake most people make these days is fall into the trap that you go to school so you can get a good job and be successful. I know I did. But education is a fundamental part of the human journey. You can't stop learning, and you don't need formal schooling to learn.
