The problem isn't fake news. The problem is a generally ignorant and uninformed populous.

This isn't anything new. Tabloids have existed for centuries(?). People gossip, spreading around false things.

Society today relies all too much on "the news" to stay informed. What most people fail to realize is that media relies on attention to make money. Our attention is shorter than ever, and as a result, media flies to potential new stories to capitalize. Telling the whole truth requires effort. It requires significant amounts of time to research and gather all the necessary information. By then, the story is old, and there's no longer attention.

This is evident when a huge story comes up and dominates headlines for 3 days, then is suddenly forgotten about for the next attention grabbing headline.

People also don't do their homework to determine what claims are credible and what isn't. They take their spoonfed news and treat it as gospel. In their mind, there's no chance that their sources could be wrong, or have any other intentions but telling the truth.

You can't stop fake news without limiting the freedom of speech and of the press. Everyone has the right to say whatever they want, regardless of the validity of their claims. In the same sense, we have the freedom to accept or deny what other people say. We need to hold each other accountable for our actions. There needs to be a much higher standard for good and truthful journalism.

Also, people pay way too much attention to current events. Contrary to popular belief, staying informed does not equal a higher quality of life. In fact, I've found that in my own life, it's stressful to stay up to date. We're contantly being barraged by news, going into information overflow, struggling to process it all. It's no wonder that people feel the need to believe everything, because there's just too much to think deeply about.
