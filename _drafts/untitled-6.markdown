title: Struggles communicating
---

Always been an introvert, but lately notice myself feeling more comfortable talking with people I don't know well. In the past, I was paralyzed by my shyness, but found comfort with those I knew well. Lately, I feel the opposite. I can interact with random people like never before. I can stand up and give a presentation to a room full of my professional peers and not bat an eye. But I have been struggling communicating effectively with the ones I love. All of a sudden, I feel like I can barely hold a conversation with people I've known for decades.

I think part of it is I'm afraid of letting them down. I close myself off because something I say or do might hurt them. I'm scared ilof ruining what we have, so I do nothing. Stepping away for a second, this is a terrible way to treat not only the ones I love, but myself too. It's not that I don't understand how to socialize. It's more that I can't control outcomes in relationships I care about. In reality, this probably arms from some of the distance I've felt in these relationships. I'm so worried that my next move is going to push them over the edge because of years of neglect.

A recent example of this, and really what sparked this post, is my inability to tell the people around me that I'll be moving. I REALLY, REALLY, wanted them to know, but couldn't muster up the courage to break the news. Its totally selfish, but I just couldn't figure out the blowback.

I'm making it my mission to interact with my family and friends much more often than I have been the last several years. I need to stop being so closed off and start realizing that I love these people and they love me, too. Every decision I make isn't going to go over well with everyone. But everyone does deserve to be in the loop. I've been a lousy partner, friend, son, brother, cousin, etc. for far too long, but it doesn't have to stay this way. I hope these people have it in their heart to forgive me and help me embrace being more open.
