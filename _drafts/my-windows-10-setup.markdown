Over the last few years, I've bounced around between using MacOS, Windows, and Linux for personal work. Most of it has been spent on Ubuntu, as I've had laptop PCs and quickly realized Windows 7/8 weren't the best for development work. Almost 2 years ago, I built a PC for gaming, but also specced it out to work as a Hackintosh. Last summer, I followed through on that and loaded up MacOS on my PC. It was surprisingly simple to get working. I used that for several months, and it was everything I thought it'd be. It's an amazing OS for the work that I do. Everything "just works" and it also helps that a majority of designers and developers use Macs for their work, so the tools and applications are top notch.

But then I also realized how much I dislike being tied to a desk. Sometimes, I just want to sit on the couch or go to a coffee shop, and I can't. Although I'm not currently looking to buy a laptop, I know it will happen eventually. Naturally, I eye out a Macbook, but dear lord, those things are insanely expensive. To make matters worse, it seems like Apple is starting to be less concerned with their laptops, both in terms of features and quality of their product.

So, I turn towards laptop PCs. You can get similarly specced high-end machines from Microsoft, Dell and company at nearly half the cost of Macbooks. I could always use Linux on one, but it's always lacked the polish of MacOS and more recently Windows 10.

Last fall, I switched back to Windows. Luckily, Microsoft has made huge strides as an OS for developers. Bash on Windows (or whatever they call it now) was not very stable the first time I tried it a year ago. But boy have they made serious progress on this front. This is what enables the "it just works" feeling that developers get with MacOS. That's because its Linux inside Windows, and while it's still not perfect, it convinced me to commit to Windows for the forseeable future.

Here's how I'm using Windows 10 as a designer and developer:

## Development

### Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

### Visual Studio Code
I used Atom for the longest time. There's nothing wrong with it, and to be honest I'm not sure there are many noticable differences between Atom and VS Code. I think I prefer Code because of the UI. I like having everything collapsed on the left bar. It's nice to just be able to flip to the Git tab to commit files quickly. I also like the integrated terminal, although I've found myself using it less often lately.

### Hyper Terminal
I know I said Bash on Windows was what convinced me that the switch was the right move, but I'm not sure I could've stayed very long if it wasn't for Hyper. The stock Windows command prompts cmd.exe and Powershell are terrible. There's next to no options for customization. You really just can't take advantage of all the cool things a Linux environment enables.

That's where Hyper comes in. It's completely configurable via JSON. There are tons of extensions and themes for it too. I've been using zsh in place of bash, and I have a good thing going in my terminal.

### Web tools: CodePen, GitHub, and Netlify(?)
Beyond the few programs above, most of the work I do happens in the browser. I kinda just prefer everything to be in a browser together. Maybe it just hides the fact that there aren't a ton of solid native apps for Windows. Why do I need a fancy Git client when I have a CLI and can view everything through GitHub on the web.

I've also found that CodePen is insane for making quick prototypes or trying out new things. Why bother with setting up an environment and including necessary dependencies when they do it for you? This isn't really a Windows specific thing, but CodePen is such an important part of my workflow I couldn't leave it out.

## Design

### Figma
A big reason why I always wanted to get a Mac was for the creative tools, mostly Sketch, that are MacOS only but essentially industry standards. But then a web-based design tool called Figma came along.

### Affinity Photo/Photoshop
I've recently discovered I have no idea how to really use Photoshop. Katie's had a Adobe Creative Cloud membership for a while, but since we've decided we don't use it enough to justify the cost, it's on the way out this year. I've heard great things about Affinity Photo so I downloaded a trial. It's really great. I don't have enough knowledge of Photoshop to really tell the difference. For my purposes, it's likely enough. I won't hesitate to switch to it when the time comes. But for now, it's still Photoshop.

## Everything else

### Google apps
I'm completely bought into the Google hardware and software ecosystem. If Chromebooks could support a fully-featured development environment, I'd switch in a heartbeat. I use Docs for storing longer-form thoughts and writing the occasional document. Sheets is self-explanatory, and Keep is the best list-making app I've used. Using the Microsoft versions of these apps hasn't appealed to me. I'm sure they've come a long way, but I'm not an office superuser to justify the costs of the subscription.

### Web apps for social
I know some people prefer native desktop apps for all of their social networking apps, but that's never worked for me. I prefer to have everything as a tab in one window if I can.

### Lightshot and LICEcap
For taking screenshots and making the occasional screen recording. Lightshot seems to be the fan favorite, and it works super well for me. I don't really make many screen recordings, but LICEcap has the same great reputation so I have it around just in case. I like that it just pops up and you can resize as needed then record. It's a very simple workflow.
