title: 'Book Review: Crush It'

Again, not anything new to me. If you follow Gary Vee, this book echos his spiel to a T. The essence of the book still rings true, and I think that anyone that doesn't know about sales, marketing, business or technology can benefit immensely from this.

Gary gives small little nuggets of gold in here that made it a worthwhile experience for me. 

Side note: first audiobook.
