title: 'Book Review: Remote'
---

Not anything revolutionary to me, more or less confirmed a lot of my thoughts on remote working.

If you've never been exposed to these ideas, but are intrigued about remote working, this book is for you. The beginning rattles off talking points for employees to use when making the case for working remotely.

Very easy read, doesn't get very wordy, finished in a couple of hours.

It seems to me like I'm not the target audience for this book. I'd already had interest and thought about remote working, so nothing in the book was revolutionary. Instead, it validated my thoughts on the topic.

The intended audience can be broken into two: management and employees of companies that don't understand remote working.
