* It's OK to have dreams, but always, always, always live in the moment. Don't waste your time looking ahead five years. Before you know it, they'll have come and gone. What will you have to show for it.
* Be open to new things and new ideas. Never, ever write something off before giving it an honest chance. You'll never know for sure until you tried.
* Have no regrets, and don't worry about having them.
* Be social. You have immense opportunities to meet new people
* You can work til your dead
* Embrace every challenge that comes your way, however boring or insignificant it may seem.

This all goes without saying that I couldn't have asked for things to go as well as they have. I'm incredibly lucky for things to worked out as they had. I do have a few things I'd done differently, but I'd never take back anything I've done.
