Welcome to my new blog, titled _My notebook_. I'm Bryan King, a front-end web developer living in Rochester, Michigan. This blog is a way to share my thoughts on design, development, business and other relevant topics. Over the past couple of months, I've been capturing my thoughts on current events in Google Docs. For the most part, that was a way to push myself to write more often. This "notebook" is me taking that to the next level. I want to share my thoughts with anyone that will listen. I'm making it my goal to post everyday, even if its just a brief paragraph of my thoughts on a topic. This will force to consider new ideas and test the strength of my personal opinions.

The release of this blog co-insides with the release of my new portfolio site. Before, this site was just used for my neglected blog. I'm interested in picking up some freelance work, so I need to put some of my work on display. (Side note: If you know anyone that is looking for some help with anything digital, point them my way). When I did the redesign, I also created a new functional CSS library, KingCSS (working name). So far, building a framework has been a ton of fun. It has been a test of my knowledge of CSS and architecture, and if nothing else, I'm a better dev as a result. I look forward to sharing more about that as it becomes more polished.

I intend for this blog to be a long-term experiment. I haven't written on a regular basis since high school. Since then, my ability to string words into semi-intelligent sentences has gone downhill. It would be great if I can use my commentary to become a coherent writer once again. It sounds cliche, and it probably is, but I hope to learn some things about myself along the way and become a better human.
