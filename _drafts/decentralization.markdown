Forget what you're being told: we're living in the greatest period in human history. Advancements of the past half century have paved the way to giving people the freedom to do whatever they want.

I think what we're seeing is people taking back their lives from governments, media, and giant corporate conglomerates. We have the power to do what we like, we are in control of our own destiny.



For every giant department store that closes, there are hundreds of small retailers selling their goods on the internet. Instead of being stuck with the same handful of TV channels, we have hundreds of thousands of content creators on YouTube whose work is 10x better than the big network TV shows.

On robots taking our jobs, and eventually control: it's horseshit. People are right when they say that we'll lose jobs to automation. But this happened 200 years ago during the industrial revolution. Here we are a couple of centuries later, more propserous than ever. Why is this? Because machines improve productivity, and more productivity equals a larger economy.
