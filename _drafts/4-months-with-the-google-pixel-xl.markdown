title: 4 months with the Google Pixel XL
---

Google's set to announce their second generation Pixel phones next week. Before seeing what the next iteration has to offer, I want to give some of my thoughts on the first Pixel.

[Software, support]

[Hardware: battery life, camera]

[Cons: no waterproofing, lost wireless charging]

[Compare practical design vs new iPhone x, Galaxy, etc]
