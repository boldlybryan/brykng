title: Introducing KingCSS
---

KingCSS is a new functional CSS library created by yours truly. When I redesigned my portfolio over at [brykng.com](http://brykng.com), I knew I wanted to use the ideas of functional CSS. I had already made a go at this, but the work that I'd done was being copy/pasted when I needed it. I figured that I could create a library that would be re-usable for this and some other upcoming projects.

Right now, you can see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brykng/kingcss). It's not in any form a finished product - I guess I'd consider it to be an alpha. There is still quite a bit of work I want to do to make it polished, but it's usable for my current needs. 

Moving forward, I need to figure out the best way to allow for configuration in different projects. A lot of it is variable-based, but I haven't nailed down the best way to customize those. Also, I'd like to create some solid user docs and a component library to show what the system is capable of creating.
