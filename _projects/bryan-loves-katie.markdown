I've had the pleasure of working with my wonderful wife, Katie, to design our wedding experience. I took on the design and development of our website. We wanted it to be a source of information for our guests to learn more about the plans for our big day. It had to be easy to use on smartphones, where we anticipate the majority of our traffic to come from. We received lots of compliments not only on the site's looks, but also the helpful information about the event!
