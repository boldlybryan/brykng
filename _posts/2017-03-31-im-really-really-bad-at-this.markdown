Today marks the fifth day that Katie and I have been living in Cincinnati, Ohio. And for the first time in weeks, I finally feel like I'm back into the swing of things. We spent about a month cleaning and packing for the move, and while we aren't quite unpacked, it seems like we're getting cozy in our new home. I spent some time today tinkering around on some side project stuff, and remembered it's been a while since I posted on this blog.

It's not that I didn't have the time or desire to write. In fact, I have at least a dozen half-finished drafts waiting to be tended to. I've had lots of ideas and even spent time putting them into semi-cohesive words, but I'm terrible at pushing posts across the finish line.

Part of it is my desire for my work to be perfect, even though I know it never will be. I spend so much time worrying if things are good enough instead of publishing it and moving on. Same thing goes for my 12 sites in 12 months challenge from my [2017 goals](http://blog.brykng.com/2017-the-year-ahead/): I have a couple of 95% done sites, but I can't bring myself to shipping them.

One positive is that I recognize that this is going on. I even started a [Daily UI challenge on Codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/DzKWYP/) to make myself put more work out there. That was going well, and I'd like to work that into the list of thing I want to do. Hell, I wanted to start vlogging my new adventures, but I'm not confident in my ability to stick to that at this point.

I need to kick my butt into gear and get to work. At the same time, I need to realize that I only have so much time, and I might not be able to do everything I want to do. For me, what it comes down to is two things: prioritizing tasks and being proactive. I need to constantly evaluate what is important to me, and then do it without finding excuses to get sidetracked.

I guess the answer is simple: just work.
