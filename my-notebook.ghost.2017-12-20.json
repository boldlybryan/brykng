I'm Bryan King, a front-end web developer living in Rochester, Michigan. This blog is a way to share my thoughts on design, development, business and other relevant topics. Over the past couple of months, I've been capturing my thoughts on current events in Google Docs. For the most part, that was a way to push myself to write more often. This \"notebook\" is me taking that to the next level. I want to share my thoughts with anyone that will listen. I'm making it my goal to post everyday, even if its just a brief paragraph of my thoughts on a topic. This will force to consider new ideas and test the strength of my personal opinions.\n\nThe release of this blog co-insides with the release of my new portfolio site. Before, this site was just used for my neglected blog. I'm interested in picking up some freelance work, so I need to put some of my work on display. (Side note: If you know anyone that is looking for some help with anything digital, point them my way). When I did the redesign, I also created a new functional CSS library, KingCSS (working name). So far, building a framework has been a ton of fun. It has been a test of my knowledge of CSS and architecture, and if nothing else, I'm a better dev as a result. I look forward to sharing more about that as it becomes more polished.\n\nI intend for this blog to be a long-term experiment. I haven't written on a regular basis since high school. Since then, my ability to string words into semi-intelligent sentences has gone downhill. It would be great if I can use my commentary to become a coherent writer once again. It sounds cliche, and it probably is, but I hope to learn some things about myself along the way and become a better human.","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Welcome to my new blog, titled <em>My notebook</em>.

I'm making it my goal to post everyday, even if its just a brief paragraph of my thoughts on a topic. This will force to consider new ideas and test the strength of my personal opinions.</p>\n\n<p>The release of this blog co-insides with the release of my new portfolio site. Before, this site was just used for my neglected blog. I'm interested in picking up some freelance work, so I need to put some of my work on display. (Side note: If you know anyone that is looking for some help with anything digital, point them my way). When I did the redesign, I also created a new functional CSS library, KingCSS (working name). So far, building a framework has been a ton of fun. It has been a test of my knowledge of CSS and architecture, and if nothing else, I'm a better dev as a result. I look forward to sharing more about that as it becomes more polished.</p>\n\n<p>I intend for this blog to be a long-term experiment. I haven't written on a regular basis since high school. Since then, my ability to string words into semi-intelligent sentences has gone downhill. It would be great if I can use my commentary to become a coherent writer once again. It sounds cliche, and it probably is, but I hope to learn some things about myself along the way and become a better human.</p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2016-11-11T14:55:04.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2016-12-02T03:56:31.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2016-12-02T03:56:31.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":5,"uuid":"3b8740a0-0dcd-4df9-980d-0206c82c5bca","title":"Introducing KingCSS","slug":"introducing-kingcss","markdown":"KingCSS is a new functional CSS library created by yours truly.

Unfortunately, I did a poor job of setting solid goals and then sticking to them throughout the year. This time, I've done my best to set realistic and quantifiable goals. To keep myself honest, I'm going to try to journal daily and do weekly and then monthly retrospective. I want to do my best to evaluate my progress against these goals all year. I don't want to look at them in the fall and realize how bad I failed. Here is a list of my goals, broken into two categories: personal and professional.\n\n## Personal goals\nI intend for this year to set the tone for the rest of my life. I want to develop habits that ensure I live a long and happy existence. By focusing on mental, physical, and financial health, I hope to live long and prosper.\n\n### Read 24 books\nTwo a month, one every other week. That seems doable. I set this same goal for myself last year, but failed miserably, completing just two in all 2016. On the plus side, I started about half a dozen more throughout the year. The reading theme this year will be finishing. I have quite the list of books I'd like to get to on deck, besides the half-read books that need to be finished.\n\n### Lose 20 pounds\nAgain, something I set for myself last year that I didn't meet. While I did lose about 15 pounds at one point, I was unable to keep it off the whole year. I'm right back at around 215, and it'd be great to get back down below 200 again. Unfortunately, my metabolism can no longer keep up with my appetite. I don't eat well, and I'm also quite inactive, especially in the winter months. For about the past week, I've gotten back into tracking my food. That'll be the biggest challenge for me. I tend to ignore my bad eating habits and ruin any fitness gains that exercise gets me during the year. \n\n### Run 2 5ks\nTo go along with my weight loss goal, I'd like to sign up for a couple of 5k runs this year. Towards the end of this past summer, I ran every other day for a little over a month. I've always hated running, but actually enjoyed it that time. My problem is that I don't push myself to stick to it. I was an athlete in high school. I used competition to help me focus on my training in the off season. I don't have that competition to focus on anymore. I think that it's part of the reason why I've struggled developing a healthy lifestyle. By entering a couple of races, I'll be able to keep myself honest in order to prepare for competition. Two seems like a  good number, but I'd like to do more if I'm able.\n\n### Be debt free by year's end\nSince we're planning on buying a house this year, it'd be nice if the remainder of my debt is paid off this year. I know there will be new expenses as a homeowner, so having my student loans out of the way will lessen those new bills.\n\n## Professional goals\nI have a harder time setting professional goals, especially quantifiable ones. I'm pleased with my job and the work I do there. I'm in a good place, and there are certainly areas I can improve, but those things can't be measured. I think that accomplishing the three goals listed here will pay off further down the line.\n\n### Take on 4 freelance projects\nLooking ahead a few years, I can easily see myself as a freelancer. I have both the skills and the entrepreneurial mindset needed to be successful on my own. The last half of this year I became extremely intrigued by the prospects of freelance work. Having the freedom to choose who you work for, how you work, and when and where you get work done will go a long way in making me happy. I hope to pick up a few side projects this year to see how it goes, with the intention of making it a full time thing in a couple of years\n\n### 12 month design and development challenge\nAt times during 2016, I found myself to be in a bit of a creative funk. I felt the desire to create something, but never knew what to do with that. If I'm going to take my freelance challenge seriously, I need to push myself to be a better designer and developer. Instead of setting abstract goals like 'become better at JavaScript' or 'Learn X programming language', I instead would just like to build stuff and learn what I need to make that happen. I am committing to the creation one thing a month, from a blank slate to a polished product. In doing this, I'll feel much more confident in my abilities as a designer and developer.\n\n### Attend a professional development conference\nCould be a fancy conference, or even a workshop would do. I haven't been to anything related to my career, outside of what's offered by my employer. It would be a great experience to get out and learn from people in the industry and get a chance to network with them.\n\n## Let's go!\nOf course, I have many more things I want to accomplish this year. I want to write more, become a better programmer, enjoy the company of the ones I love, et cetera, et cetera. But those things really can't be measured. The seven goals stated here are [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm), and can progress against them can clearly be measured throughout the year. I'll be doing regular check-ins regarding these goals in order to stay on top of them.\n\nI'm confident that 2017 will go down as the best year yet. My beautiful fiancee, Katie, are getting married. We'll be heading overseas for the first time to honeymoon in France. We're also going to be purchasing our first home together. I plan on making the best memories over the next year. I want to be be able to remember how much I grew as a person this year, too!\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you follow me on the great journey of 2017!\n\n","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>Last year was the first time I've ever set serious goals for myself.

It was intriguing enough for me to pick it back up at the start of the new year, and I was quickly engrossed in this one.\n\nI honestly didn't know what to expect when I bought this book. It was very well reviewed on Google Play Books, and I've heard lots of buzz about it on podcasts, blog posts, etc. To be honest, I was thinking it was going to be a read about \"lifehacks\": quick tips and tricks to improve your life. In reality, that's the opposite of the argument posed in the book. Instead, Covey lays out a framework for living life. He advocates for what he calls \"principle-based living\". His argument is that if you truly know and understand what you value in life, you can always lean on that whenever you face challenges in life.\n\nHere are the seven habits that Covey believes will help you be effective:\n\n> 1.  Be proactive\n> 2.  Begin with the end in mind\n> 3.  Put first things first\n> 4.  Think win-win\n> 5.  Seek first to understand, then to be be misunderstood\n> 6.  Synergize\n> 7.

Instead of going habit-by-habit, I'll go through my takeaways and favorite quotes in my summary.\n\nIf I had to synthesize Covey's point, I'd say that as humans, we first and foremost need to take responsibility for our own actions. It takes great self-awareness to understand what we do and why we do it, but if we can't get past ourselves we'll never make anything happen with others. Second, it is extremely important to develop a serious system of values to live by. From there, you immediately know what is really important and are able to prioritize things accordingly. Lastly, we need to really care about the people around us. This includes intently listening and making sure that people know we truly care for them, despite any shortcomings, hard times, or differences.\n\nI plan on revisiting this book on a regular basis - even if its just to skim through. Despite being written almost three decades ago, there are so many good little nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout that still hold true today. Covey inspired me to take inventory of what matters most. I have started to put together my principles, and plan on writing a mission statement of my own. \n\nI'll leave you with a particular passage that stood out to me:\n\n> Once we are self-aware, we must choose purposes and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum will be filled, and we will lose our self-awareness and become like groveling animals who live primarily for survival and propagation.

Gwynne was my first pure \"pleasure\" read of the year. Fresh off of finishing [*7 Habits*](http://blog.brykng.com/book-review-7-habits), I wanted something lighter to read. I breezed through the book in a couple of evenings.\n\nGwyenne's book tells the story of Hal Mumme, one of the unsung heroes of modern offensive football. Mumme is the father of the [\"Air Raid\" offense](http://smartfootball.com/offense/the-air-raid-offense-history-evolution-weirdness-from-mumme-to-leach-to-franklin-to-holgorsen-and-beyond#sthash.Qqan6l8Z.dpbs), one of the most influential schemes of the last couple of decades. Mumme bounced around from high school, to college, then back to high school football until he perfected his formula at Iowa Wesleyan College in the late 1980s. He peaked in the late 90s, when he rode phenom Tim Couch to national prominence at the University of Kentucky.\n\nMumme's influence is nearly never-ending in today's game. His coaching tree includes some of the biggest names in college football today: Mike Leach, Dana Holgorson, Kliff Kingsbury, Art Briles and more. Even the NFL quickly adopted many of Mumme's Air Raid concepts. This is especially evident when you flip through a playbook in Madden, where play names like \"Y Cross\" and \"Mesh\", originally coined by Mumme, appear verbatim.

Gwynne was my first pure \"pleasure\" read of the year. Fresh off of finishing <a href=\"http://blog.brykng.com/book-review-7-habits\"><em>7 Habits</em></a>, I wanted something lighter to read. I breezed through the book in a couple of evenings.</p>\n\n<p>Gwyenne's book tells the story of Hal Mumme, one of the unsung heroes of modern offensive football. Mumme is the father of the <a href=\"http://smartfootball.com/offense/the-air-raid-offense-history-evolution-weirdness-from-mumme-to-leach-to-franklin-to-holgorsen-and-beyond#sthash.Qqan6l8Z.dpbs\">\"Air Raid\" offense</a>, one of the most influential schemes of the last couple of decades. Mumme bounced around from high school, to college, then back to high school football until he perfected his formula at Iowa Wesleyan College in the late 1980s. He peaked in the late 90s, when he rode phenom Tim Couch to national prominence at the University of Kentucky.</p>\n\n<p>Mumme's influence is nearly never-ending in today's game. His coaching tree includes some of the biggest names in college football today: Mike Leach, Dana Holgorson, Kliff Kingsbury, Art Briles and more. Even the NFL quickly adopted many of Mumme's Air Raid concepts. This is especially evident when you flip through a playbook in Madden, where play names like \"Y Cross\" and \"Mesh\", originally coined by Mumme, appear verbatim.
